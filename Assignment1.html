<p> A Premed (pronounced <em>Pre-med</em>) is a sub-type of humans who are working hard to get into a  Medical School. Specific characteristics of this sub-type changes depending upon the country. The Canadian subtype is considered to be the worst form of all the premeds in the world.  These types of humans are not often seen in public, spending most of the time studying. When they are seen in public, it will be when they are volunteering at a community center or a charitable organization. These humans are prone to low social activities in comparison to the SPAMA program, which is made of very socialized humans. These humans are either depressed or at the borderline depression as their future is very uncertain unlike 90% of other programs that exist. Due to the depressing lifestyle and immense competition, this subgroup is also very toxic to fellow premeds. Unless you donâ€™t have friends, it is almost impossible to survive in this environment due to the toxic environment and heavy workload.  Most premeds do not know what they are doing in terms of getting into medical school. This property is highly reflected when looking at certain premed forums.
