<p> A Premed (pronounced <em>Pre-med</em>) is a sub-type of humans who are working hard to get into a Medical School. Specific characteristics of this sub-type changes depending upon the country. The <strong>Canadian subtype</strong> is considered to be the worst form of all the premeds in the world.  These types of humans are not often seen in public, spending most of the time studying. When they are seen in public, it will be when they are volunteering at a community center or a charitable organization. These humans are prone to low social activities in comparison to the SPAMA program, which is made of very socialized humans. These humans are either depressed or at the borderline depression as their future is very uncertain unlike 90% of other programs that exist. Due to the depressing lifestyle and immense competition, this subgroup is also very toxic to fellow premeds. Unless you don’t have friends, it is almost impossible to survive in this environment due to the toxic environment and heavy workload.  Most premeds do not know what they are doing in terms of getting into medical school. This property is highly reflected when looking at certain premed forums.

<h3> Ranking Medical Schools in Ontario (From Most Difficult to Easiest) </h3>
<ol>
  <li>The University of Toronto
    <ul>
      <li>If you ever had a single bad grade in your undergrad, forget about getting into this and start focusing on a different school. The website says the Average Admitted GPA was 3.85 but everyone knows you need something higher than that (yes you need a 4.0) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Michael G. Degroote School of Medicine – McMaster University
      <ul>
        <li> This Medical school will not care about what you did in your undergraduate degree as long as you have 132 on the Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS) section on MCAT. If you happen to get that score, don’t bother applying elsewhere. Just apply Mcmaster. This school is placed higher on the difficulty list because it is not common in the Premed world to see a student with 132 on the CARS section of the MCAT. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>UOttawa Medical School
      <ul>
        <li>A decent university to apply to. Very critical of grades, just like McMaster. However, there are a higher number of prerequisites required by this school, which is something that other schools in Ontario don’t have. The prerequisites are also subjecting to change every other year. Due to this reason, the writer (me) is very annoyed with this school </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry - Western University
      <ul>
        <li>The most realistic university that anyone can try to attend. Very forgiving of bad grades. However, requires stellar extracurriculars (similar to the one on the table below). Also, it has been heavily criticized by fellow Ontario applicants due to having a preference towards SWOMEN (Southern Western Ontario Medical Education Network) which other Medical Schools do not have </li>
      </ul>
    </li >
    <li> Queens Medical School
      <ul>
        <li> Another School that is very forgiving of bad grades. It looks at your last two years, so if you happen to be cruising in the first two years and went downhill from the third year this is not the school for you to apply to. Very extracurricular heavy, similar to Western. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    I believe this information can give you a good idea of the current state of premeds in Canada and the medical school application status. When looking at the neighboring countries, such as the USA, the requirements are relatively low. It can be attributed to the high population and a high number of med schools willing to accommodate many people. The writer of this page (aka me) is also a premed student who has high hopes of making it to a Medical School in Canada. However, due to the insane competition, it makes it look like this is not a feasible target to achieve but at the same time, I still believe that  I have what it takes to get there, thus making me still pushing for this goal that I want to achieve. I seriously hope one day I can make it :)
