  <p class="p1"> Hiking is my favorite hobby to do when I have free time. I didn't like hiking as a kid, but I've grown to love it over the years. My exposure to hiking became when my siblings, where they always dragging me along on hikes even when I didn't want to go. However, I began to give it a try during my early teens and have been loving it ever since.  </p>

  <p class="p2"> I have been on a lot of hikes in various parts of the world, including deserts, topical rainforests and fjord environments. I  enjoy hiking because hiking helps me to relieve stress and allows me to enjoy some of the amazing creations of nature, such as animals, waterfalls, and lookout points with fascinating views.  My types of hiking could even be very simple as walking along the Glenridge quarry, all the way to difficult ones, such as the Gros Morne hike in Newfoundland. I love Niagara even more than my hometown, as it is home to a number of hiking trails with interesting sights such as scenic viewpoints and waterfalls compared to other places in Ontario. I've been on almost every hiking trail in Niagara during my stay at Brock.</p>

<h2> Hiking in Niagara </h2>
</div>

<div>
<p class="p3"> There are a lot of hikes in the Niagara region, mainly due to the Niagara escarpment. Niagara escarpment has not only created the impressive Niagara falls but also created a countless number of hikes. These hikes include Canada’s oldest and the longest walk, the Bruce Trail. Niagara hikes are more attractive compared with other hikes as there are different hikes with different difficulty levels, from dangerous rock climbing hikes to leisure strolling hikes. As someone who isn’t from Niagara, it always amazes me how people have utilized the escarpment to form some of the fantastic walks in the province.
