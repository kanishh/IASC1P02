<h2>How I got into stargazing </h2>

<p class="p1"> As a kid, I grew up in an area with minimal light pollution, which gave me spectacular sights of night sky signs. Over time I developed a curiosity to find out the meaning with the starts and stories behind them. Since I grew up near the equator, I was fortunate to see almost every constellation from both northern and southern hemispheres, which counts to about 88 constellations. I find stargazing equivalent to reading a picturebook, or watching a movie, as there are interconnecting stories between stars and constellations. So far, I have been lucky to witness 5 of 7 visible planets, multiple lunar and solar eclipses, meteor showers, and satellites.
</p>

<p class="p1"> Over the years, I have paid limited attention to stargazing due to my diminishing eyesight; however, I still can't help but get excited when I randomly stare at the sky and recognize a constellation :)
</p>


<h2> What I use </h2>

<p class="p1"> I used books and maps to observe patterns and constellations as a child.  I used a computer program called 'Stellarium' during the pre-smartphone era. It's a program that can give accurate data on planet positions, stars, and constellations. Nowadays, I use an app called "Skyguide." It is a paid app found on the apple store, and it is considered one of the best stargazing apps out there. It uses AR and the phone's gyroscope to position stars, thus making interesting and accurate images of constellations and planets. I highly recommend it if you are ever interested in stargazing
