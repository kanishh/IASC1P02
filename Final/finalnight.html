  <p class="p1">Night sky is a place with many fascinating scenarios. If you stand outside and stare at the night sky for a couple of minutes, you will be a amazed to see the number of amazing things you can see in a short time.
</p>


<h2> Constellations </h2>

<p class="p1"> There are about 88 constellations in the night sky. Even though many of them are not visible due to light pollution and our northward location, we are still lucky to observe some iconic constellations. Some of the 'must-know' constellations are below
  </p>

  <h3> Orion </h3>

<p class="p1"> This is my favorite constellation of all time. It is easily recognizable through the three bright stars in its belt. The constellation is named after Orion, a skilled hunter in Greek mythology. It's one of the most famous constellations in the night sky due to its attractive shape and the star 'Betelgeuse,' which is one of the brightest red supergiants in the sky.
</p>

<p class="p1">
According to Greek stories, Orion was a very skilled hunter. Orion wanted to marry seven sisters who were the daughters of Titan Atlas. Scared, the seven sisters started to run away from Orion but couldn't keep running away. The sisters decided to meet the god Zeus to find a solution. Zeus turned the seven sisters into stars and sent them to the sky. These seven sisters became the Pleiades cluster. After hearing this news, Orion and his guard dog (Canis Major constellation) decided to turn into stars and went to the sky to catch the sisters. Once Zeus got the news, he sent an ox (Taurus constellation) in between them to protect the sisters. Even today, you can see Orion aiming at ox while his dog is standing next to him. The sisters (Pleiades) are staying safe, hiding behind Taurus.
</p>

<h3> Big Dipper </h3>


<p class="p1">This is the third largest and a famously recognized constellation in the night sky. It is also known as Ursa Major, which translates to ‘Great Bear’. It consists of 4 stars that make up a box (body of the bear) and 3 other stars that make up its tail. The Big Dipper is also used to identify ‘Polaris’ aka the North Star, by extending the line drawn between the two stars found in front of Big Dipper’s body. Big dipper shines during the summer months, and can be found closer to the northern horizon during winter months.</p>

<h3> Scorpius </h3>

<p class="p1"> I always find Scorpius to be the constellation that closely resembles what it stands for. Scorpius, which indicates a Scorpion, is also found in the twelve zodiac signs, and it has a shape similar to the letter ‘J’.  However, it is difficult for us to observe, as it is found in the southern sky. Therefore, one must travel to an area with a clear view of the Southern horizon.  Looking at the southern hemisphere from the shore of Lake Erie during summer nights is the best way to observe the Scorpius constellation. </p>

<h2> Planets </h2>

<p class="p1"> 5 of 7 plants in the night sky are visible to the naked eye. Planets are easy to distinguish from others, as their light is constant and does not twinkle like the stars. Some of the most iconic planets are as follows.</p>

<h3> Jupiter </h3>

<p class="p1"> Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It is the second brightest planet visible in the sky. If you notice a bright light in the top of the sky, the chances are that you are looking at Jupiter, as it is one of the two bright planets that reach high up in the sky (Saturn is the other one). </p>

<h3> Mars</h3>

<p class="p1"> If you are looking at something that is not a star and red-colored, you are most definitely looking at Mars. This red appearance. ‘Mars’ is the Roman God of war, and the plant has gotten its name due to its iconic red color. </p>


<h3> Venus</h3>

<p class="p1"> Venus is the third brightest object in the sky, coming only after the sun and the moon. The name venus comes after the Roman goddess of Love due to its beauty. It has a tight orbit around the sun, making it always hang close to the sun. Due to this property, it will always be observed either right after sunset or before sunrise. Therefore, it was either known as the morning star or the evening star by the ancients. However, a famous Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, figured out they were the same object.</p>

<h2> Satellites </h2>

<h3> ISS </h3>

<p class="p1">International space station is the brightest artificial object in the night sky (excluding satellite flairs). It serves as a research laboratory, where research is been conducted in the fields of astrobiology, astronomy, physics and other fields. It is also the largest object flying in the lower orbit, flying at only 400km altitude. ISS travels at a speed of 7.66km/h, therefore takes about 93 minutes to spin around the earth, making 15.5 orbits a day.ISS is so bright, such that it can be clearly seen even during environment with light pollution. I have witnessed it multiple times in Thorold, as well as in St. Catharines due to its high brightness, and it can look even brighter than a plan flying in the night sky.
